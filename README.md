# Error Level Analysis

Steps:

 * Implement ELA algorithm on a jpeg image using C/C++.
 * For above C/C++ code, Implement a python wrapper using cython.
 * compare the results of ELA for an image captured from your mobile phone versus the same image after photoshop (or any kind of image editing). This part of  scripting should be done in python using cython wrapper that you wrote earlier.
